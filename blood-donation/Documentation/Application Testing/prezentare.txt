Regarding the testing part of the application, it wasn't an easy thing to do, as we envolved both manual and automation testing.
To manage my work easily I've created specific Test Cases for the app, and these contained tests regarding functionality, compatibility, usability, interface, security and performance.
Each case had points on how important hard it is to perform the test, how much is it testable, a status - Passed, Failed, In Progress, To Be Performed and so on -, a progress percentage and in how much time it took to finish.
The Performance Test was made using JMeter to test for Connection Speed, Load and Stress but it is still work in progress.
Bug reports were written in Trello, those include title, description, steps and an attachment for the issues found. Finally, I've made a test report with the results which contains documentation on how the test is performed and the current results for the application.
On the automation part, we've written scripts in C# using the Selenium Webdriver framework, and checked for specific elemets to exist in the page and lots and lots of asserts.
In the end, I've learned how to properly test a web application, and it was a pleasure to work such an amazing team.
